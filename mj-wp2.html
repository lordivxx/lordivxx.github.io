    <section id="soil">
      <h2>Soil and Growing Medium Factors</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Soil Texture &amp; Structure:</strong> Cannabis thrives in a well-structured, well-draining soil. Loamy soil (a balanced mix of sand, silt, and clay) is ideal as it offers excellent drainage along with sufficient moisture retention. Heavy clay soils can waterlog roots, whereas overly sandy soils may dry out too quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Soil pH:</strong> An optimal pH range for cannabis is 6.0–7.0 in soil (or 5.5–6.5 in soilless media). Maintaining this pH ensures nutrients remain soluble and accessible to the roots.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC):</strong> This property indicates the soil’s ability to retain nutrients. High CEC (found in soils rich in clay or organic matter) means the soil can hold more nutrients and deliver them gradually to the plant.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Organic Matter &amp; Nutrient Content:</strong> Rich organic material improves water retention, structure, and supports beneficial microbial populations. Typically, organic content around 5–15% is recommended to build soil fertility.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Indoor vs. Outdoor Considerations:</strong> Outdoor growers often amend native soils (e.g., adding compost or gypsum to clay) to improve structure, while indoor growers typically start with engineered soilless mixes that are pre-adjusted for optimal conditions.
      </p>

    <!-- Soil Microbiology Section -->
    <section id="microbes">
      <h2>Soil Microbiology and Beneficial Microbes</h2>
      <details open>
        <summary>View Details on Beneficial Microbes</summary>
        <p>
          <strong>Rhizobacteria and PGPR:</strong> These bacteria decompose organic matter, release nutrients in plant-available forms, and produce hormones (like IAA) that stimulate root growth. They also offer a degree of protection against pathogens by outcompeting harmful microbes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Mycorrhizal Fungi:</strong> Cannabis forms arbuscular mycorrhizal associations, which dramatically extend the root system’s effective surface area. These fungi improve phosphorus uptake and overall water absorption. Studies have shown that inoculating with mycorrhizal fungi can significantly boost biomass and cannabinoid production.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Actinomycetes:</strong> These filamentous bacteria help break down tough organic compounds and produce natural antibiotics that suppress soil pathogens. Their presence contributes to nutrient cycling and overall soil health.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Other Soil Biota:</strong> In addition to bacteria and fungi, the soil community includes protozoa and nematodes that help release nutrients during feeding. A diverse microbiome establishes a "biological shield" enhancing plant resilience.

    <!-- Plant Nutrition Section -->
    <section id="nutrition">
      <h2>Plant Nutrition and Fertilizers</h2>
      <details open>
        <summary>View Detailed Nutrient Information</summary>
        <p>
          <strong>Macronutrients:</strong> Cannabis needs high levels of nitrogen (N) during the vegetative stage for rapid leaf and stem development, while phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) are crucial during the flowering stage for bud formation and overall plant strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Micronutrients:</strong> Essential elements like calcium, magnesium, iron, manganese, zinc, copper, boron, and molybdenum are needed in trace amounts for enzyme function and overall plant health. Their availability is tightly linked to soil pH.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Synthetic vs. Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Synthetic fertilizers offer immediate, precise nutrient delivery but must be managed carefully to avoid toxicity. Organic amendments, such as compost, worm castings, bat guano, and bone meal, release nutrients more slowly while enhancing soil life.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Nutrient Uptake &amp; Toxicity:</strong> Proper nutrient uptake depends on a healthy root system and balanced water flow. Overfeeding can cause nutrient burn and lockout, while underfeeding results in deficiencies. Monitoring the Electrical Conductivity (EC) and PPM of the nutrient solution is critical.
        </p>
      </details>

    <!-- Light Sources Section -->
    <section id="lighting">
      <h2>Light Sources and Spectra</h2>
      <details open>
        <summary>View Full Light Report</summary>
        <p>
          <strong>Light Intensity &amp; Photosynthesis:</strong> Cannabis has a high light requirement with optimal PPFD values varying by stage—seedlings (100–300 µmol/m²/s), vegetative stage (400–600 µmol/m²/s), and flowering (600–900+ µmol/m²/s). The Daily Light Integral (DLI) is also critical.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Light Spectrum:</strong> Blue light (400–500 nm) keeps plants compact while red light (600–700 nm) promotes photosynthesis and flowering. Supplemental UV-B can boost cannabinoid production as a protective stress, and far-red influences plant morphology.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Lighting Technologies:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Sunlight:</em> Provides the full spectrum with very high intensity but variable conditions.</li>
          <li><em>Fluorescent (CFL/T5):</em> Useful for seedlings and clones due to lower intensity and minimal heat.</li>
          <li><em>Metal Halide (MH):</em> Rich in blue light; ideal for vegetative growth.</li>
          <li><em>High-Pressure Sodium (HPS):</em> Rich in red/yellow; excellent for flowering but produces significant heat.</li>
          <li><em>LED:</em> Efficient, customizable spectrum with lower heat output; modern full-spectrum LEDs can closely mimic natural sunlight.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Photoperiod:</strong> Vegetative growth is maintained with long days (typically 18 hours of light), while flowering is induced by 12/12 light/dark cycles.

      <h2>Environmental Controls (CO₂, Humidity, Airflow, Temperature, VPD)</h2>
      <details open>
        <summary>View Environmental Details</summary>
        <p>
          <strong>CO₂:</strong> Outdoor plants use ambient CO₂ (~400 ppm), while indoor growers enrich to 800–1500 ppm to boost photosynthesis and yield, especially under high light.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Temperature:</strong> Optimal day temperatures are around 24–30°C; night temperatures should be slightly lower (16–22°C) to promote proper metabolism without causing stress.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Humidity and VPD:</strong> Maintaining optimal relative humidity is key. Seedlings require 70–80% RH; vegetative plants do best at 50–70%; and flowering plants typically need 40–50% to reduce mold risk. VPD (vapor pressure deficit) should ideally stay between ~0.8–1.5 kPa.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Airflow and Ventilation:</strong> Adequate air movement replenishes CO₂, removes excess humidity, and strengthens plant stems. Indoor systems use fans and ventilation to prevent stagnant microclimates.

      <details open>
        <summary>View Biochemical Processes</summary>
        <p>
          <strong>Photosynthesis:</strong> Cannabis uses photosynthesis to convert light, CO₂, and water into sugars (biomass). This process is central to plant growth, relying on chlorophyll and enzymes such as Rubisco, which are sensitive to temperature, light intensity, and nutrient availability.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Transpiration:</strong> The evaporation of water from leaves creates a suction force that pulls water and dissolved nutrients up from the roots. This process is moderated by stomatal behavior and influenced by environmental factors such as temperature and humidity.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Nutrient Transport:</strong> Nutrient uptake occurs via mass flow and active transport. Once absorbed, essential elements are assimilated by enzymes that depend on optimal conditions (pH and temperature). Deficiencies or excesses affect enzyme efficiency and overall growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Enzyme Activity:</strong> Many enzymes involved in photosynthesis, respiration, and secondary metabolism (such as cannabinoid synthesis) have specific optimal conditions. Proper temperature and pH are essential for maximizing catalytic efficiency.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Cannabis growth is influenced by a complex interplay of soil quality, microbial life, precise nutrition, lighting (both intensity and spectrum), and controlled environmental factors like temperature, CO₂, and humidity. From the early seedling stage to flowering and harvest, each factor requires careful balance. In optimized conditions, efficient photosynthesis, water and nutrient uptake, and enzyme metabolism work together to produce robust plants with high yields and potent resin profiles.
      </p>
      <p>
        By monitoring and adjusting these factors—using the metrics in this guide—cultivators can simulate and implement the best practices for maximizing cannabis quality and productivity.

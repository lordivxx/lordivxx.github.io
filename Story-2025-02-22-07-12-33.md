Professor Alistair Finch, Director of the Institute for Absurdly Specific Research (IASR), believed strongly in team bonding.  So, despite the collective groans echoing through the lab when he announced a mandatory "motivational hike," he herded his team into the whispering depths of Redwood National Park.

Alistair, a man whose physique suggested more time spent with petri dishes than pull-up bars, strode ahead, babbling enthusiastically about the symbiotic relationship between banana slugs and redwood sorrel.  Behind him trailed a motley crew:  Briony, the perpetually stressed post-doc clutching a triple-shot latte;  Finn, the intern whose primary research seemed to be into the optimal nap position; and Edgar, the eccentric senior researcher who communicated primarily through interpretive dance.

The trail narrowed, sunlight dappling the forest floor.  Alistair, captivated by a particularly vibrant patch of moss, veered off the path, beckoning his team forward.  "Behold!" he exclaimed, gesturing dramatically. "Hypnum cupressiforme, also known as cypress-leaved plait-moss!  Note the intricateâ€¦"

He trailed off.  The moss, it turned out, concealed a gaping hole hidden beneath a layer of fallen leaves. Alistair, mid-sentence, disappeared with a surprised yelp.

Briony sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose.  Finn, ever opportunistic, saw a potential napping spot.  Edgar, however, sprang into action.  With a series of graceful leaps and pirouettes, he conveyed to the others that Alistair had likely fallen into an abandoned badger sett. He then proceeded to demonstrate, through a remarkably accurate imitation of a badger digging, how they should excavate the professor.

After twenty minutes of digging, aided by Briony's latte-fueled frantic scooping and Finn's surprisingly effective sleep-excavation technique (apparently, he was a champion sleep-walker), they unearthed Alistair. Covered in dirt, leaves, and a bewildered badger, he emerged blinking in the dappled sunlight.

"Remarkable!" he exclaimed, brushing himself off. "I believe I've just discovered a previously unknown subspecies of badger with a peculiar affinity for tweed jackets.  Briony, make a note! We'll need to secure funding for further research!"

Briony, Finn, and even Edgar, exchanged weary but amused glances. They knew one thing for sure: a hike with Alistair Finch was never dull.  And, who knew, maybe they *would* discover a new subspecies of badger.  Stranger things had happened at the IASR.

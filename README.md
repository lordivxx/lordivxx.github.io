| [Story-2025-02-22-07-11-07.md](Story-2025-02-22-07-11-07.md) |A vibrant crew of quirky scientists from the "eye-sore" Institute for Absurdly Specific Research embark on a hilariously disastrous hike. Poison ivy, disco-ball mushrooms, a rogue green concoction, and a selfie-loving squirrel collide in a symphony of absurdity, culminating in the discovery of rhythm-inducing fungi and a guaranteed grant for even more peculiar research. |
| [Story-2025-02-22-07-12-33.md](Story-2025-02-22-07-12-33.md) |A motley crew of quirky researchers, led by their overly enthusiastic professor, embark on a "motivational hike" in Redwood National Park.  Their adventure takes a hilarious turn when the professor disappears down a badger hole, leading to an impromptu excavation mission involving interpretive dance, latte-fueled digging, and champion sleep-walking. They unearth not just their professor, but the possibility of a new badger subspecies, proving that even team-building exercises can lead to absurdly specific discoveries. |
| [Story-2025-02-22-07-24-09.md](Story-2025-02-22-07-24-09.md) | A zany professor, a mossy newt, and glowing lab coats!  Follow the wacky adventures of Professor Thistlewick and her team of eccentric researchers as they stumble through a redwood forest seeking time-traveling newts, origami-delivery swans, and other absurd scientific pursuits.  Will they unlock the secrets of the universe?  Probably not.  But it'll be a hilarious ride! |
| [Story-2025-02-22-07-25-30.md](Story-2025-02-22-07-25-30.md) | A quirky team of researchers from the Institute for Absurdly Specific Research (IASR) embark on a "Team Building Through Mild Peril" hike in Redwood National Park.  Their mission? Collaboration, and maybe discovering a new species of iridescent moss.  But things take a psychedelic turn when lost-as-usual Kevin stumbles upon hallucinogenic mushrooms, sending the dust bunny expert into a spore-collecting frenzy. Mild peril just got a whole lot weirder, and a whole lot more fun. |

Poison ivy, disco-ball mushrooms, a rogue green concoction, and a selfie-loving squirrel collide in a symphony of absurdity, culminating in the discovery of rhythm-inducing fungi and a guaranteed grant for even more peculiar research. |
| [Story-2025-02-22-07-12-33.md](Story-2025-02-22-07-12-33.md) |A motley crew of quirky researchers, led by their overly enthusiastic professor, embark on a "motivational hike" in Redwood National Park.  Their adventure takes a hilarious turn when the professor disappears down a badger hole, leading to an impromptu excavation mission involving interpretive dance, latte-fueled digging, and champion sleep-walking. They unearth not just their professor, but the possibility of a new badger subspecies, proving that even team-building exercises can lead to absurdly specific discoveries. |
